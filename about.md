title: About
---

I'm Tomas. I have experience in programming (Python, Scala, Haskell, Nix, shell 
scripting), Linux system administration, computer networking, and statistical 
machine learning.

I did a PhD in statistics for a while, but I quit. I realized that there are
much easier ways to ruin my mental health, so I now do infrastructure work 
instead.

Although I'm Czech, my last name means "fish" in Finnish.

# Hobbies

I love hoarding books at a faster pace than I'm able to read them; typically 
science fiction or magical realism. I also like metal music, gaming and cats. 
I'm a big hummus and coffee enthusiast, and am willing to spend absurd amounts 
of money on those. Finally, I enjoy seeing overhyped "AI" technologies fail 
spectacularly.

# Software preferences

In general, I dislike software that attempts to be smarter than its user. Such
efforts fail more often than not, get in the way, and feel somewhat insulting.
Instead, I prefer simple programs that do one thing well and are friendly to
system resources. Sadly, this isn't always possible, for instance with web
browsers or mobile phones.

I browse the web using Firefox, behind a wall of uBlock Origin, Sponsorblock
and my Pi-hole instance.

My favorite text editor is vim. I use it in combination with tmux and a window
manager: i3 or sway. After more than 8 years of using vim, I can confidently
say that I don't know almost anything about it.

My preferred programming languages are C, Go and Lua. I don't use any of them 
at my day job, but I typically develop my hobby projects in one of these.

I run Arch Linux on my laptop and desktop computers (even for gaming, thanks to 
Valve's recent efforts to support Linux gaming), and NixOS on my server and 
Raspberry Pis. My mobile phone runs GrapheneOS.
