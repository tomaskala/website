title: About
---

I'm Tomas. I have experience in programming (Python, Scala, Haskell, shell
scripting, ...), Linux system administration, statistical machine learning and
computer networking.

I did a PhD in statistics for a while, but I quit. I realized that there are
much easier ways to ruin my mental health, and now I work in network traffic
analysis instead.

Although I'm Czech, my last name means "fish" in Finnish.

# Hobbies

I love hoarding books at a faster pace than I'm able to read them -- science
fiction, typically. I also like metal music and gaming, though I usually play
the same games over and over. I'm a big hummus and coffee enthusiast, and am
willing to spend absurd amounts of money on them. Finally, I enjoy seeing
overhyped machine learning technologies fail spectacularly.

# Software preferences

In general, I dislike software that attempts to be smarter than its user. Such
efforts fail more often than not, get in the way and feel somewhat insulting.
Instead, I prefer simple programs that do one thing well and are friendly to
system resources. Sadly, this isn't always possible, for instance with web
browsers or mobile phones.

I browse the web using Firefox, behind a wall of uBlock Origin, Sponsorblock
and my Pi-hole instance.

My favorite text editor is vim. Neovim, to be exact, although I don't use any
of its IDE-like capabilities. I use it in combination with tmux and a window
manager: dwm or sway. After more than 8 years of using it, I can confidently
say that I don't know almost anything about it.

I use neomutt for reading email, mpv for watching videos, and a custom wrapper
around music player daemon for listening to music.

My preferred programming languages are C, Go and Lua. I don't use any of them at
my day job, but I typically develop my hobby projects in one of these.

I play games on an older Windows computer, though I'm optimistic about Valve's
recent efforts to support Linux gaming.
