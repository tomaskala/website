Hello! I'm Tomas, a programmer and a tech enthusiast based in Prague. Although 
I'm Czech, my last name means "fish" in Finnish.

I work in backend development, usually related to computer networks and 
security in some way. I have experience in implementing network traffic parsers 
and in writing scalable systems. Before that, I used to do statistics and 
machine learning, but that feels like a different life now.

In general, I dislike bloated, monolithic software, preferring instead smaller 
services that each do one thing well, and are well orchestrated together. More 
often than not, my work involves transforming the former into the latter.

This website is my space to share ideas, whether anyone reads them or not. 
You'll find here posts about gadgets that I've been playing with, interesting 
ideas that I found in books somebody smarter than me wrote, and tutorials I 
wrote for myself to not forget later.

In my free time, I enjoy hoarding (and sometimes also reading) science fiction 
books, attending metal concerts, and looking at cats. I'm a huge coffee and 
hummus fan spending a bit too much on both. Lately, I've picked up learning 
Finnish; let's see how long I last.

If you'd like to get in touch, you can reach me via my [public 
email](mailto:contact@tomaskala.com) or
